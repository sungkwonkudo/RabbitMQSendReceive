RabbitMQ convertSendandReceive demo

<h2>spring-boot-amqp-messaging</h2>
This one has both the sender and receiver in the same service. 

<h2>spring-boot-amqp-messaging and spring-boot-amqp-messaging</h2>
These are essentially spring-boot-amqp-messaging, except separated.
There is virtually nothing different besides the fact that it's 2 
separated spring boot apps, with nearly the exact same files.
